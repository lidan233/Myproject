> A curated list of My projects.

## Computer Graphics

* [SimpleVR](https://github.com/lidan233/VR) - This project is a simple VR implementation. 
* [MeshFormer](https://github.com/MeshFormer/MeshFormer) - This project is the offical implementation of paper "High-resolution mesh segmentation". 
* [newCpuRender](https://github.com/lidan233/newCpuRender)  - The project is a fast rasterizer with BVH and different ZBuffers. 
* [swc2obj](https://github.com/lidan233/swc2obj) - Expand the line to mesh with metaball algorithm in more than 10T data. The biggest challenge is to ensure the water tightness of mesh.   
* [eulerOperator](https://github.com/lidan233/eulerOperator)  - CAD project for basis  euler operator. 
* [objCDchecker](https://github.com/lidan233/objCDchecker) - Fast collision detection using BVH and Cuda.
* [BezierAndBspline](https://github.com/lidan233/BezierAndBspline)  - Different implements for Bezier and Bspline. 
*  [Cuda](https://github.com/lidan233/cudaAlgorithms/tree/master/execute) -Some basis algorithm implemented by cuda. In this project, I also implement the interaction between cuda context and opengl context. 
* [supermario](https://github.com/lidan233/lidan_super_mario) - a simple game named super mario. 
* [DelaunayTriangle](https://github.com/lidan233/surfaceReconstruct1DelaunayTriangle/) - Triangulate points using Divide and conquer algorithm.
* [render](https://github.com/lidan233/render) - Render teeth with BRDF and BSDF. 
* [surfaceReconstruct2Marchingcube](https://github.com/lidan233/surfaceReconstruct2Marchingcube) - Basis marching cube algorithm. 



## Other project
